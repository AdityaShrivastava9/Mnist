Here the code for recognizing the handwritten digits has been posted.
The transfer learning was used in order to train the model on the dataset containing images of handwritten digits. The model that was used as transfer learning model was `ResNet 50`.

The model was trained on basically just **4 lines of code**. It had achieved an accuracy of around 98%.

Here are the images of when it predicted the wrong results.
